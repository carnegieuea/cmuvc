            <h2>About Us</h2>
          </div>
          <p>The <strong>Carnegie Mellon University Venture Challenge</strong> is an annual, international start-up competition where students from around the world come to CMUâ€™s Pittsburgh campus to pitch their creations. For 12 years, the CMUVC has been bringing top students to launch their ideas, technologies, and talent. We receive over 100 applications every year from universities all over the country, as well as several international applications. For each of the 12 finalists, the CMUVC brings together a strong network of resources, including mentorship from serial entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, attorneys, and the opportunity to present and pitch to a panel of judges and the city of Pittsburgh.</p>

      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS</h2>
      <p>Student teams that compete at CMUVC are offered
a unique value proposition - exposure, funding, and feedback. The vast majority of early stage companies require significant prototyping funds before a working product can materialize. CMUVC aims to objectively reward innovative teams with capital, discounted services, and constructive feedback from experts in a variety of technical and legal domains, in order to help teams grow from the experience. Teams compete for a chance at winning one of three awards, which all come with in-
kind legal services, a cash prize, and media exposure. Past winning teams, such as Inventory Connection, an inventory tracking system for major retailers, went on to secure contracts with major grocers in the Midwest. Other teams like Quorum became full- time, providing data analytics-driven political advocacy support on a democratized platform. CMUVC offers teams a chance at unlocking more of their potential, enabling innovators to truly push their creations to the limit.</p>
